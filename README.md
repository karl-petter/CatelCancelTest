CatelCancelTest
===============

Small Catel project to investigate possible issue with a ViewModel decorated with the [Model] attribute.

Using Catel 3.9.0 such ViewModel changing a property in an object of the Model will set the wrong value when the editing is cancelled.

Will investigate if this is true for 4.0.0 as well.
